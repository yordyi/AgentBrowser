## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix native binary distribution in npm package. Native binaries for all platforms (Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64) are now included in the npm package. Previously, the release workflow published to npm before building binaries, causing "No binary found" errors on installation.
